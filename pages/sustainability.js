            <p>
              The need for Industrial Packaging is growing worldwide. Our
              Sustainability Vision is to deliver the best packaging products
              and monitor the entire process of internal and supply chain
              packaging through ‘Ecogauge’. This ensures that we can achieve our
              sustainability vision, empowering ourselves and helping our
              customers become carbon-neutral and a carbon negative
              organization. {siteConfig.name} has developed Ecogauge, which
              calculates carbon emission for the total design & development
              process in the initial stages of development to provide
              sustainable design solutions with less to zero carbon footprint.
